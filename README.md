# Calculator_in_Python

Creating a voice input calculator using Python involves combining the power of speech recognition with basic arithmetic operations. The goal is to allow users to speak mathematical expressions, and the program will recognize the speech, evaluate the expression, and provide the result.

To start, we need to install the SpeechRecognition library using pip. Then, we initialize the speech recognizer and microphone objects. The microphone will capture audio input, while the recognizer will convert it into text.

The main loop listens for user input through the microphone. The recognized speech is converted to text using Google's speech recognition service. If the input is understood, it is passed to the evaluation function. This function utilizes Python's built-in eval() function to compute the mathematical expression.

For example, if the user says "What is two plus three?", the speech recognizer will capture the audio, convert it to text ("two plus three"), and the evaluation function will calculate the result (5) and display it.

The program will keep running until the user says "exit" or terminates the script. Throughout the process, we ensure proper error handling to deal with potential recognition issues or evaluation errors.

The voice input calculator demonstrates a simple but practical application of speech recognition and basic programming logic, making it an exciting and user-friendly way to perform calculations without the need for traditional keyboard input. It also serves as a foundation for more advanced voice-controlled applications and opens up possibilities for exploring natural language processing in Python.
